No. But my great nephew keeps researching them and finding theyâ€™re all fake . He did this because I got scammed out of about $23,000 which I certainly could not afford thinking I was going to win 150,000. Not so sadly, not so.

My problem is depression. Losing Howard, my first husband whom I think you knew, in 2002 then losing John, husband, number two in 2022, the depression piled up on me and weighed me down. I am trying, trying, trying to climb up out of the pit, but I guess it just takes time

Who is your doctor?

I am going to have a heart catherization procedure done that may also install a stint or it may progress to a open heart bypass surgery if that is indicated. I have been having pains in my chest, left arm and pulsating headaches in the left side of my head. These are indications that I might have a heart attack, hence the reason for the heart Cath procedure. Meanwhile I hope you are feeling better.

Oh yes, and I will put you on my prayer list". I hope you are better soon, my dear, and that you have confidence in your doctor. I donâ€™t mean that ugly, I just know doctors sometimes overlook things. Blessings BIG TIME, And definitely stay in touch!
