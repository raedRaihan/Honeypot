Hello Agent Linda,
My friend Rosalie Griffin (Mrs. Bill) said I should write you and ask about a grant. My name is Stephanie Smith-Wilkey, I live in Atlanta which is my home town in the exquisitely beautiful piney woods of northeast Texas (Cass County). I am two months away from my 79th birthday and, sadly, have just been widowed for the second time in 20 years (2002 and 2022). Rosalie thinks you have grants I should apply for and, as I am retired with not many hot prospects to apply for, I‚Äôm inquiring if I would qualify for a grant. Please tell me what you need to know. I thank you in advance for your consideration.

I‚Äôm having a hard time with things. The hurt and sadness in my heart just won‚Äôt go away. I‚Äôm trying to get the house organized but I‚Äôm just overwhelmed. About the only things I have of John‚Äôs that his kids didn‚Äôt take are the pillow from his heart surgery and a backscratcher. I hug the pillow but the backscratcher isn‚Äôt very cuddly. I‚Äôll be fine eventually. Michael was just here for the second time in 2weeks and comes every month. I need to get the house straightened so I can have people over. Right now it‚Äôs just the 6 cats and 2 dogs (I had to put Anna down on Tuesday which is part of my blueness i know). I‚Äôm plugging along and I‚Äôll get there soon!
Love to you and Jessie Bill!
